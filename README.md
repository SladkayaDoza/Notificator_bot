- **Script Execution:** Upload Python scripts and receive output directly in Telegram.
- **Task Management:** View, stop, and manage active tasks.
- **User Management:** Control access through a whitelist system.
- **System Monitoring:** Check CPU, memory, and disk usage.
- **Request System:** Apply for whitelist access directly via Telegram.

### Sending Scripts
1. Prepare a Python script with a `.py` extension.
2. Send the script as a document attachment to the bot.
3. The bot executes the script and responds with the result.

## Example Script

Simple example:
```python
print("Hello, Telegram!")
```

Script with calculations:
```python
result = sum([i for i in range(1, 11)])
print(f"Sum of numbers from 1 to 10: {result}")
```

Script with a delay:
```python
import time
time.sleep(5)  # 5-second delay
print("Execution completed!")
```

---

## Task Management
- View all tasks using `/tasks`.
- Stop any active task with `/kill <task_id>`.
- Logs for executed scripts are saved in the `logs/` directory.

---

## Restrictions

- **No Infinite Loops:** Scripts exceeding execution time limits are terminated.
- **No Inputs:** Scripts requiring `input()` are not supported.
- **Memory Limit:** Scripts using excessive memory will be terminated.

---

## Logs and Monitoring
Logs for executed scripts are saved in the `logs/` directory, with timestamps and outputs.
System performance can be checked using the `/bot` command, displaying CPU, memory, and disk usage.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: Invalid File Format**: Ensure the script has a `.py` extension.
- **Execution Timeout**: Optimize the script for shorter execution times.
- **Permission Denied**: Request admin approval through `/request`.
